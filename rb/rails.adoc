=== Why Minitest, not RSpec

* Minitest is the testing framework used in the Rails Guide
* Plain Ruby (Minitest) > Domain Specific Language (RSpec)

* Simplicity
* Learning curve

Rspec::
Pros:::
* Test are very easy to read and figure out what they are trying to verify
* CLI is simple. You can easily run a specific example (even if the example is defined using metaprogramming)
* The tools for stubbing and verifying method calls are simple and intuitive
* Creating a matrix of different scenarios is easy through shared contexts, lets and the example hooks (before, after, around)
Cons:::
* Takes longer to learn the DSL since it is not pure Ruby
* Tests take longer and have a larger memory footprint
* Requires libraries for doing things that come out of the box with minitest (such as fixtures)

Minitest::
Pros:::
* Runs much faster than rspec
* Tests are written in pure Ruby
* Outputs not only number of examples, but also number of assertions
* Comes with fixtures and many Rails assertions out of the box
Cons:::
* CLI isn't the best. Hard to run a specific example
* Stubbing or verifying method calls is not as intuitive as in rspec
* Harder to create a matrix of scenarios since you cannot nest contexts as in rspec
