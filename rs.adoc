= Rust

.Lessons learned
* Use new scope for statements prepared at a transaction
* Do not implement the CLI yourself! Use e.g. clap instead...
* Closures and functions are not (easy) interchangable
* Use `.expect(msg)` to support yourself
* Logging > `println!`
* `cargo` allows workbenches
* upcasting is a mess
