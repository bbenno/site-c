== Documentation Driven Development (DDD)

[[RDD]]
== README Driven Development (RDD)

<<RDD>> can be considered as a subset of <<DDD>>

[horizontal]
Motivation::
Software is worthless if it solves the wrong problem or nobody can use it e.g. due to lack of documentation.
Characteristics::
Write READMEfootnote:[Single file of documentation intended to be an introduction] first.
Advantages::
* Enforces thoughts about project.
* Writing README at the beginning of the project (when excitement and motivation are at their highest) is mostly easy compared with writing it retroactively.
* Prevents lengthy or overprecise specification.
* Rewards keeping libraries small and modularized.
* Makes discussions simpler. (written downs prevents endlessly, circling talks)
